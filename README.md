# Searchmetrics interview

## Context to the coding task
We recommend not to spend more than 8 hours on this task. Please start with the most important aspects of the project to you.

If you are not able to fully implement the task - this is fine, but please explain what needs to be done in order to have a production ready application.

## Coding task
Please develop a service, that constantly checks the currency exchange rate from Bitcoin to US-Dollar (1 Bitcoin = x USD).

## Requirements
- The check period has to be configurable
- The service must have a REST API with the following endpoints:
- Get latest rate
- Get historical rates from startDate to endDate
- Please describe in a few sentences and/or with a diagram how you planned the project and architecture.
- It should be coded in Java

## Principles
* KISS - keep it simple, stupid
* Single responsibility / Separation of Concerns
* DRY - Don't repeat yourself
* Composition over inheritance
* YAGNI - you ain't gonna need it (no over-engineering)

only use patterns if they make sense and provide a benefit
